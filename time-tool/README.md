Our team is developed an application that will allow users to find free-time amidst a busy schedule encompassing academic, extracurricular and leisurely commitments. 
Functionally, the application is very straightforward. Students will provide as input to the system, a .ics calendar file of their schedule. Alternatively they may input commitments individually through the application.

Multiple students will be able to input their different schedules and our system will output a variety of times that each individual is free. Students will be able to use this system to easily schedule group meetings, events, or social activities!

The application will be based heavily on the use of “.ics” files, which is a common file type for calendars.
